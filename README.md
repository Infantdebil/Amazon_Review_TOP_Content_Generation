# **Robo Review to Marketing Affiliate Approach**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on clustering product categories and generating meaningful insights using unsupervised learning techniques, semantic embeddings, and modern language models. The ultimate goal is to assist in developing a marketing affiliate approach by grouping similar products, analyzing customer sentiment, and providing actionable summaries for recommendations.

The project performs three main tasks:
1. **Sentiment Analysis** of product reviews using VADER to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
2. **Product Category Clustering** with K-Means to group products into 4 meaningful categories.
3. **Summarization** of customer feedback and cluster-based recommendations using Cohere's large language model (LLM).

## **Key Features**
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Used VADER to classify customer reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
- **Clustering**:
  - Applied **K-Means** on embeddings generated by Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to cluster product categories into 4 groups:
    - **Tablets**
    - **Smart Home Devices**
    - **E-Readers**
    - **Others**
- **Summarization**:
  - Leveraged Cohere's LLM to generate summaries and actionable recommendations for each product category.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas: For data manipulation.
  - scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering.
  - TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub: For Universal Sentence Encoder embeddings.
  - Matplotlib: For data visualization.
  - Cohere API: For LLM-based summarization.
  - VADER: For sentiment analysis.
- **Pretrained Models**:
  - Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE): To generate semantic embeddings for clustering.
  - Cohere's LLM: For generating summaries.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: Kaggle
  - *[Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products)*
- **Description**:
  - Approximately **34,000 product entries** with columns like:
    - `name`: Product names.
    - `categories`: Product categories.
    - `reviews.text`: Customer reviews.

---

## **Workflow**

### **1. Sentiment Analysis**
- Preprocessed the `reviews.text` column by:
  - Cleaning the text (removing special characters, stopwords).
  - Feeding the cleaned text into VADER.
- Output: A new column `sentiment` indicating positive, neutral, or negative reviews.

### **2. Product Category Clustering**
- Preprocessed `name` and `categories` by combining them into a single column (`name_and_category`).
- Generated semantic embeddings using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).
- Applied K-Means clustering to group products into 4 clusters:
  1. **Tablets**
  2. **Smart Home Devices**
  3. **E-Readers**
  4. **Others**
- Validated the clusters using PCA visualization and word frequency analysis.

### **3. Summarization**
- Used Cohere’s LLM to generate summaries for each cluster by feeding:
  - Cluster-specific product names, reviews, and categories.
- Output: Summarized recommendations and marketing content highlighting key products for each category.
